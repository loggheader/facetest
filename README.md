# facetest
small demo with opencv facerecognizer tools

to build type

make

but you will need apart from the main opencv source , the opencv_contrib code which can be found here:

https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib

and follow instructions there to build, as the face module is required to use the eigenfaces, fisherfaces and local binary pattern histogramms algorithms provided by opencv.

Nonetheless, due to potential compilation problems, a script will be uploaded asap, with a precompiled version of the library just in case.
